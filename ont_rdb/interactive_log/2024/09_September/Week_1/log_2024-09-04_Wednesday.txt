2024-09-04 14:13:06 - Unforunately all previous ont_rdb logs were deleted. That's OK, I can move forward. I should have tried to recover them when the deletion occurred but ultimately things have gone smoothly without the informatin that was lost.
2024-09-04 14:14:27 - I am launching a new project, the "project_manager" version 1.0, at this moment I can probably try to adjust how the project launcher works. That will be preferable for when I try to regroup the more complex TADs and boundaries project, which has an older framework. Starting a new project from scratch seems easier than regrouping the older structrue.
2024-09-04 14:15:44 - First I will check to see how the project launcher does at present, and compare with the scHiCluster_wrapper structure. I have outlined the modules that should be present somewhere previously.
2024-09-04 14:17:04 - The main question is about the explorer script. I can see what it's like.
Also, at some point it may be nice to have everything more centralized. IDK, maybe it's OK or even preferable to have things decentralized and somewhat self contained.
2024-09-04 14:18:45 - Some notes right off the bat:

(1) Probably it would be nice to automatically include the project log in a chosen "meta log."
(2) At some point I should remove that silly ontology dataframe thing or fix it.
2024-09-04 14:20:53 - 
I can at this point start to indicate what modules and structures have already been included in the explorer notebook generated by launch project, and compare them with the process notebook of scHiCluster wrapper.
2024-09-04 14:23:44 - For the first cell, the newer structure initializes the Informant_Dataframes_dict object (which is used so frequently it should probably have a shorter name, perhaps even just idfs) as well as a function to save informant dataframes.
2024-09-04 14:24:48 - The main function to be addressed is create_explorer_notebook, definitely. I can already modify the first cell.
2024-09-04 15:15:03 - I'm making a lot of progress, I may need to do some debugging with some syntax, and I think I also want to "front load" the definitions of functions. I could also include the functions as part of the ont_rdb package.
2024-09-04 15:57:56 - OK, well I totally revamped the launch project script. It's way better and includes a lot.
It may also be nice to include "reminders" for users to store the name of the environment they used for particular algorithms. That would take care of the metadata thing potentially. Users could just have the environment set up however they like and make sure to keep track of which ones they use for what tasks. In principle, they could even bake that into the execution, but I hesitate to do that.
